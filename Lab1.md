# Lab 1- Multi-Device Network with Router, Switches, and Wireless Connectivity

## ðŸ§  Objective
Simulate a small network with a PC, router, wireless router, switches, and a laptop. Practice designing a mixed wired/wireless network and identify connectivity issues.

## ðŸ§° Devices Used
- 1x PC
- 1x Laptop
- 2x 2960 Switches
- 1x 2911 Router
- 1x Wireless Router
- Copper cables and wireless connection

## ðŸ›  What I Did
1. Connected PC to Switch2
2. Connected Switch1 and Switch2 to Router1
3. Connected the Laptop to the Wireless Router (wireless)
4. Started configuring IP addresses and testing links

## ðŸ§ª Result
Some connections are active (green lights), some are not (red lines). I will troubleshoot router configuration and wireless setup next.

## ðŸ§¾ What I Learned
- How to design and cable a mixed network topology
- The role of routers, switches, and access points
- How to identify interface or IP config issues visually
