# ðŸ§  Networking Labs Portfolio â€“ Cisco Packet Tracer Projects

Welcome to my networking lab portfolio! I'm learning hands-on by building and troubleshooting real-world networks using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, and documenting each project here.

These labs help me build the skills required for roles in **network support, IT infrastructure, and cybersecurity**.

## ðŸ“š Completed Labs

| Lab | Title | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| âœ… [Lab 1](Lab1.md) | PC-to-PC via Switch | A basic LAN setup using switches and static IP addresses |
| âœ… [Lab 2](Lab2.md) | Routed PC + Laptop | Two subnets routed using a 2911 router between a PC and a Laptop |

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer (Network simulation)
- Markdown (for documentation)
- GitHub (for portfolio management)

---

## ðŸ“ˆ What I'm Learning
- IP addressing and subnetting
- Router & switch configuration
- VLANs, NAT, ACLs (coming soon!)
- Troubleshooting broken networks
- Real-world network topologies
